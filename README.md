## Setup

### Bash

1. When cloned in a location other than `$HOME/.dotfiles`, the `DOTFILES_LOCATION_DIRECTORY` environment variable, which is declared in the `src/.bash_profile` file, needs to be modified to the actual path.
2. Create symbolic links to each `src/.bash_profile` and `src/.bashrc` as these steps:  
  ```bash
  ln -s '<path/to>/src/.bash_profile' "$HOME/.bash_profile"
  ln -s '<path/to>/src/.bashrc' "$HOME/.bashrc"
  ```
3. All is done. you then just login by establishing new terminal session.

```bash
